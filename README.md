### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an electrical engineer who is passionate about programming. 

I have learned many important programming skills such as algorithms and logic, and I am always learning new languages and techniques.

My focus is currently on web programming, and I am working hard to master HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. 

Although I started programming as a hobby, I am now taking it more seriously and looking for ways to use my skills in real-life situations. 

Sometimes I struggle with procrastination, but I am determined to overcome it and achieve my goals as a developer.
